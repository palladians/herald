# Why Does the World Need Herald?

While existing libraries also replicate the general SSI model, Herald can generate proofs that can be used as one of several arguments to other `ZkProgram`s or smart contracts; this is were the powers of recursive proofs come alive. This is a critical feature to reduce the amount of interaction necessary with smart contracts and off-chain `ZkProgram`s that are identity aware.
