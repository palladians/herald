# Tooling

Herald is made to be **100%** Mina-compatible out of the box. 
This means that you can leverage all existing Mina toolbox which you can find a list of [here](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/zkapps/snarkyjs).

Moreover, Herald is built upon SnarkyJS so you can actually *also* leverage existing TypeScript tooling.
